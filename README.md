GrubDash Project

Bootcamp project: the back-end of a fictional food app, GrubDash. Demonstrates intermediate API capabilities of Node.js and Express.js while adhering to the design principles of representational state transfer (REST). Uses two datasets: Orders and Dishes.

Built Express endpoints and business logic for orders and dishes using CRUD operations.
